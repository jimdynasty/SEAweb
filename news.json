Tickets are going to go fast…especially for the **London CLEOPATRA EXTRAVAGANZA** (this genius of a rhyme came from my publicists mind).\n\nThank you to all the booksellers who are championing this release by opening their doors to little ol’ me.\n\nA _huge_ thank you to my wonderful moderators and fellow panellists. You guys rock, I’m so excited to do these events with you.\n\nThese aren’t the only events I’ll be doing this year - there’ll be many more festivals and events to come.\n\nAnd if you’re based on the US East Coast keep an eye out in the coming weeks...\n\nTickets are limited and selling fast.
