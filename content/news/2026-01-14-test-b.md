**BOSTON: 19th Feb**
I get to chat to the amazingly talented [@kuangrf](https://www.instagram.com/kuangrf/) at the iconic Brattle Theatre in collaboration with the [@narrativebookshop](https://www.instagram.com/narrativebookshop/) —a proudly immigrant-woman owned & operated bookshop, with an emphasis on amplifying marginalized voices & experiences.

**NYC: 23rd Feb&#160;**
Every visit to NYC takes me to [@strandbookstore](https://www.instagram.com/strandbookstore/) so I’m so so excited to be launching CLEOPATRA there—and with the incomparable [@thechloegong](https://www.instagram.com/thechloegong/) as well? This night is going to be epic.

Thank you to the bookstores and the [@ballantinebooks](https://www.instagram.com/ballantinebooks/) team for all the work behind the scenes. Now it’s up to you guys to grab those tickets.
